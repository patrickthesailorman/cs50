# Questions

## What's `stdint.h`?

`Header file`. Library providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types

## What's the point of using `uint8_t`, `uint32_t`, `int32_t`, and `uint16_t` in a program?

Using clearly defined types makes the code easier to read and safer to use.
Also lets the machine know exactly how much memory to allocate.

## How many bytes is a `BYTE`, a `DWORD`, a `LONG`, and a `WORD`, respectively?

BYTE = 8 bits = 1 byte
DWORD= 32 bits = 4 bytes
LONG = 32 bits = 4 bytes
WORD = 16 bits = 2 bytes

## What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."

`WORD` and denotes `bfType`, which specifies the file type. It must be set to the signature word `BM (0x4D42)` to indicate bitmap

## What's the difference between `bfSize` and `biSize`?

`bfSize` specifies the size of the bitmap file in bytes.
`biSize` specifies the size of the structure in bytes.

## What does it mean if `biHeight` is negative?

If `biHeight` is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB (device-independent bitmap)
and its origin is the upper left corner.

## What field in `BITMAPINFOHEADER` specifies the BMP's color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

The biBitCount member of the `BITMAPINFOHEADER` structure determines the number of
bits that define each pixel and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap.

## Why might `fopen` return `NULL` in lines 24 and 32 of `copy.c`?

Invalid address or file does not exist

## Why is the third argument to `fread` always `1` in our code?

refers to quantity, as in number of elements(1).
nmemb âˆ’ This is the number of elements, each one with a size of size bytes.

## What value does line 63 of `copy.c` assign to `padding` if `bi.biWidth` is `3`?

`3`

## What does `fseek` do?

skip over `padding`, if any

## What is `SEEK_CUR`?
